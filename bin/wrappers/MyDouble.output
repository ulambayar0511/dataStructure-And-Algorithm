Testing the MyDouble wrapper class
The test array is 1.0 2.0 5.0 10.0 17.0 
2.0 + 5.0 = 7.0
5.0 - 2.0 = 3.0
2.0 * 5.0 = 10.0
5.0 / 1.0 = 5.0
The zero element is 0.0
The identity element is 1.0

2.0 compareTo(5.0) = -1
5.0 compareTo(2.0) = 1
5.0 compareTo(5.0) = 0

2.0 == 5.0 = false
2.0 == 2.0 = true

The sum of the numbers is 35.0

After swapping the first and last elements, the test array is 17.0 2.0 5.0 10.0 1.0 

The maximum element is 17.0
