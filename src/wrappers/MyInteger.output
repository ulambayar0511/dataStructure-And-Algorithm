Testing the MyInteger wrapper class
The test array is 1 2 5 10 17 
2 + 5 = 7
5 - 2 = 3
2 * 5 = 10
5 / 1 = 5
The zero element is 0
The identity element is 1

2 compareTo(5) = -1
5 compareTo(2) = 1
5 compareTo(5) = 0

2 == 5 = false
2 == 2 = true

The sum of the integers is 35

After swapping the first and last elements, the test array is 17 2 5 10 1 

The maximum element is 17
